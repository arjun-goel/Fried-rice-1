Chop the garlic and the white part of the green onion.....my bunch had slight green, it doesn't matter at all.


I use my food processor to chop the veggies, dunk all the veggies into the processor and blitz.


Heat a wok or any large heavy bottomed pan, add 3 tbsp oil. Add the chopped garlic, this is to infuse garlic flavor into the oil (you can remove the fried garlic if you dont like garlic in your food). I love garlic, so I let it stay there. Remember the rule of the thumb here is high flame.




Than add the chopped white part of the spring onion.(high flame pls). Stir well.



Add the chopped veggies.


Still on high flame, stir well......stir fry the veggies...about 3 to 4 min.


Add the 1 tbsp of soya sauce, 1 tsp red chilly sauce, 1 tsp oyster sauce (if using), and sprinkle salt. The veggies should only be half cooked. Sprinkle 1 tsp of pepper powder.


Remove the veggies into another plate. Add 1 tbsp of oil and drop in the eggs. (if you are not using eggs skip this part)


Stir the eggs, vigorously..


And scramble it.


Sprinkle 1 tsp pepper and salt.


Put the veggies back in. Mix well.


And add the cooked rice. Mix everything nicely.


Sprinkle chopped spring onion (the green part). Mix well. Switch off the fire.


Annnnnnnd Serve.
